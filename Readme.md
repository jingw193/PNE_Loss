## Positive-negative equal contrastive loss for semantic segmentation

This repository is the **PyTorch** Implementation.

Our experiment is based on the MMsegmentation 0.13 version.

Due to our proposed PNE loss being plug-on-play, we provide the code of PNE loss and an example to apply the PNE loss on the ASPP decoder in the MMsegmentation framework.
